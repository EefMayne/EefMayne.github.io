                        <p> I really enjoyed playing a lot of new games on PC. Tom Clancy's The Divison really stood out to me, and really kick started my passion for gaming and eventually I.T</p>

                        <h1>I.T in my life</h1>
                            <p>My interest in I.T stems from four interests of mine; Gaming, Hacking, Graphic Design, and Computer Aided Design. I have always been a keen gamer, which started my interest in computers. I then found out about the graphic design and computer aided design fields when I started Year 11 in High School. This boosted my interest in I.T and started looking into computers and how they work even more. After finishing up at High School I wanted to expand my knowledge in computer systems even more, so I started learning several coding languages, and teaching myself the basics of Hacking. I discovered hacking was a massive passion of mine after talking to a friend who works as a Certified Ethical Hacker. I guess my interest in hacking really started when I grew older and wanted to understand how computers work aside from just the face value and electronic understanding. I wanted to find out how the systems worked, and the things we take for granted have come to exist.</p> 

                            <p>I chose to come to study at RMIT due to several reasons. After talking to my friend, he recommended doing a course in Information Technology which would give me the basics of I.T and would allow me to narrow down which path I wanted to follow in the future. I then searched online for degrees and after some research I decided to go with RMIT due to recommendations made by prior students. It works out well for me to study online as I have severe fatigue issues which prevent me from attending University in person. So, I am happy with my choice of University.</p> 

                            <p>I expect to learn about a broad range of Information technology related subjects. I hope to learn about the many ethical issues around IT, as well as all the ways IT is used and will be used in the future. It would be great to learn about systems and how the internet works in depth. </p>
