                        <p>The results for this first test werent actually that suprising. It took me about 10 minutes to do this personality type test. It then compiled the results and placed me in one of 16 different personality types. According to the website <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16 Personalities</a> I am a Campaigner. This didnt take me by suprise really after reading the description.</p>

                        <blockquote cite="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">
                            "The Campaigner personality is a true free spirit. They are often the life of the party, but unlike types in the Explorer Role group, Campaigners are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd."
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>I feel like this descibes my personality quite accuratley. I am quite extroverted which mean I'm often the life of the party. Personally I believe that I am a massive people person and the fact that it says that Campaigners enjoy social and emotional connects over excitement and pleasure fits quite nicely into my life.</p>

                        <p>If you look at the chart to the right. It states that I am 87% extroverted which I believe is the most correct thing about this test. There are very few situations that I come across where I am introverted. It also says that I am extremely intuitive. This I believe is quite accurate, generally I dont observe situations and then act based off what I obeserved. Usually I just act and then go from there. Less thinking more acting. This sometimes results in me ending up in hot water. But also occasionaly leads t awesome experiences and I live life on the edge. The next bar shows that the way I make decisions is pretty even between thinking and feeling. This is quite innacurate in my opinion. When I am making a decision its usually always based of how im feeling. I very rarely think about my decisions. Which isnt probably a great thing. Now onto my tactics. I think that it is quite accurate, because after thinking about how I usually go about things there is a fair bit of prospecting and searching. Its less judgement and more just trying to find the right way than having it decision based. In regards to my identity, I am quite turbulant and have issues with being confident in my abilities even when I know I can do something I often tell people Im not good enough etc. I prefer to undersell myself than oversell myself. But overall I think that this personality test has done a good job of showing me how my personality can be broken down into different areas.</p>
