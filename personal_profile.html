                        <h2>The Myers-Briggs personality test</h2>
                        
                        <p>The results for this first test werent actually that suprising. It took me about 10 minutes to do this personality type test. It then compiled the results and placed me in one of 16 different personality types. According to the website <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16 Personalities</a> I am a Campaigner. This didnt take me by suprise really after reading the description.</p>

                        <blockquote cite="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">
                            "The Campaigner personality is a true free spirit. They are often the life of the party, but unlike types in the Explorer Role group, Campaigners are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd."
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>I feel like this descibes my personality quite accuratley. I am quite extroverted which mean I'm often the life of the party. Personally I believe that I am a massive people person and the fact that it says that Campaigners enjoy social and emotional connects over excitement and pleasure fits quite nicely into my life.</p>

                        <p>If you look at the chart to the right. It states that I am 87% extroverted which I believe is the most correct thing about this test. There are very few situations that I come across where I am introverted. It also says that I am extremely intuitive. This I believe is quite accurate, generally I dont observe situations and then act based off what I obeserved. Usually I just act and then go from there. Less thinking more acting. This sometimes results in me ending up in hot water. But also occasionaly leads t awesome experiences and I live life on the edge. The next bar shows that the way I make decisions is pretty even between thinking and feeling. This is quite innacurate in my opinion. When I am making a decision its usually always based of how im feeling. I very rarely think about my decisions. Which isnt probably a great thing. Now onto my tactics. I think that it is quite accurate, because after thinking about how I usually go about things there is a fair bit of prospecting and searching. Its less judgement and more just trying to find the right way than having it decision based. In regards to my identity, I am quite turbulant and have issues with being confident in my abilities even when I know I can do something I often tell people Im not good enough etc. I prefer to undersell myself than oversell myself. But overall I think that this personality test has done a good job of showing me how my personality can be broken down into different areas.</p>

                        <h2>The Learning Style Test</h2>
                        
                        <p>The second website I used was called <a href="https://www.howtolearn.com/">HowToLearn.com</a>. Its a website all about how people learn and how to maximise your learning capabilities. It also includes a learning style quiz that you can take which helps you understand how you learn best. After taking the 10 minute test, it came up with these results.</p>
                        
                        <strong>38% Visual Learner - 38% Auditory Learner - 23% Kinesthetic Learner</strong>
                        
                        <p>Personally I think that I learn much better with Visual and Kinesthetic the most (Kinesthetic being hands on). I'm not a great listener but I can when I need to be. I am a good listener when I am also doing something with my hands or having something visual aswell. So when I need to learn heaps I try and do something where I'm listening to someone speak while they present something. Because that way I learn best. Besides that, the test was quite accurate. When forming a team, I think its important for me to realise people learn in different ways, so if I'm trying to help someone or work together with someone I might need to adapt what were doing to make sure its beneficial for all of us. I dont think that these results would affect how my team works, as its a pretty well rounded result which means that I can cope with any method of learning, just some are better than others.</p>

                        <h2>Interpersonal Skills Self-Assessment</h2>
                        
                        <p>The third test I took was through the website <a href="https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ls/index.php/343479?lang=en">Skills You Need</a>. Its a really interesting test to do, I found it quite challenging to answer some of the questions. But once I got the results it made sense. My overall score was 59%. After completing the quiz it said this.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote cite="https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ls/index.php/343479/">
                            "Based on the answers you provided your interpersonal skills are about average â€“ compared to other people.  Although you have a basic grasp of the key interpersonal skills, there is still a lot you can do to improve them further.  Spend some time practising and developing your interpersonal skills to enhance your relationships with others further."
                        </blockquote>
                    
                        <p>This didnt take me by suprise as I knew that I had okay inter-personal skills but they do need some work. After breaking it down and reading through the results it made a bit more sense.</p>
                        
                        <strong>46% Listening Skills - 60% Emotional Intelligence - 52% Verbal Communication - 73% Communicating in Groups</strong>
                        
                        <p>This made a bit more sense. As I said before I dont have great listening skills, my verbal communication is about average. And my Emotional Intelligence and Communicating in Groups are above average. Overall, I believe this test was quite accurate and really highlighted the things that I need to work on to develop my Inter-Personal Skills. I think that it will influence the way I act in any team in the future, because I will be more self aware of my listening, and hopefully will become a better listener because I now know I'm not great at it. This will improve the standard at which I function in a group. The fact that I now know that I have an above average group communication will probably boost my confidence when doing public speaking etc. And in the end, help me pursue group work and not be scared about working in groups. When forming a team, I think its important to know the 4 types of Inter-Personal skills and whos got strengths in what area. You can then organise the group to play to each persons strengths, resulting in a gorup that fucntions to the best of its abilities.</p>
