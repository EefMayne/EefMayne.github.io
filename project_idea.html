                        <h2>SubComp</h2>
                        <h4>(for lack of a better name)</h4>

                            <h3>Overview</h3>

                                <p>For this I.T related project. I have chosen to create a website. This website will address the growing need to encourage local business's while allowing people to save money. The idea stems from the need for a subscription-based payment towards local businesses that you buy from on a regular basis. The website would collate and present available subscriptions while also showing you how much you could save. It would start off in website form, but hopefully also end up as a mobile application. After some research, I don’t believe there are any websites that cater to this exact need.</p>

                            <h3>Motivation</h3>

                                <p>The motivation for this project came when I was at a coffee shop locally like each Wednesday. I was thinking about how much money I spend monthly and then yearly and realized that there are a lot of other people that come here every morning for their coffee. If the business had a membership program that allowed people to pay a certain fee which would allow them to buy the coffee half price it would attract more customers. After talking to a fair few people, I realized that most people are happy to part with $50 dollars sometimes more a month if they know they can get cheaper stuff because of it. So, if I created a website that allowed people to search for their favorite coffee shop or gift shop that they regularly buy stuff from and sign up for a discount I would fill a need for local businesses getting their name out in the community while allowing people to get cheaper drinks/food/items etc.</p>

                            <h3>Description</h3>

                                <p>The website will be called SubComp (couldn't really think of anything else). The idea is, we would approach companies asking if they have a rewards system of some sort. So, a customer would pay a certain amount per day/week/month/year and then receive stuff at a discount or for free based off what they pay. If they did, we would ask them if they wanted to get their name out more and work with them to put together a subscription system where people pay a certain amount to receive discounts or free stuff every time, they go in to the store. The sight would then compile all these different stores. You would then be able to search for stores based off name, location, services offered etc. and subscribe to them for different amounts. There would be different subscription levels for each store. So, the more costly subscriptions would give you more, while the cheaper ones would be discounts or just less free stuff. This would let the customers save money, while also allowing them to keep all their rewards in one website or application. You would be able to upgrade your subscription if you choose or cancel at any time. You could modify your subscription to allow you to get discounts on different items in the store if you purchase them more often. It's all about accessibility. You wouldn’t have to carry around all your different rewards cards that only let you do certain things, you would be able to pick and choose your rewards while having the easy access on your laptop or mobile. It would also let you book or order ahead for items. You would also be able to add an amount of your choice to your subscription if you wish to support a charity of our choice, this charity would change monthly. Or you can choose to add a dollar or two to your subscription which would go to a fund for the store your subscribing to, this fund would finance them to enable homeless people to come in and get “free” food. Funded by yourself.</p>
                        
                                <p>The companies would get a lot of popularity through this website as it puts their name out there on the web more and will attract more customers because they know they will save money if they go there regularly. After the research I did I discovered that people will spend money if they know that they will save money. Even if they weren’t going to spend that money in the first place. So, having that money saving incentive there will attract more customers. It also appeals to people's sense of doing good, as they can give to a charity without giving too much. Having the rewards means that people will spend more than they would without the savings, so the companies will get more of an income. Overall, it works out well for the customer, as they get cheaper items, and save money over time. The companies, as they get more customers, and therefore more income. The charities, as they get an income from the customers which enables them to help more people. And the website, as ad revenue, as well as a 2% surcharge on all subscriptions.</p>

                            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

                                <p>The main tools and technolgies required are a computer with a solid internet connection, a website hosting service, a knowledge in advanced Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), HyperText Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, C++, Python, and HyperText Preprocessor (PHP). These 5 coding languages are needed to write all the code for the webpage and make sure it runs smoothly. Most of my learning for these languages come from doing short courses through Udemy, and then practicing them as much as possible. That’s pretty much the only things I would need to know or own to be able to set up this website.</p>

                            <h3>Skills Required</h3>

                                <p>The main skills I need to learn are JavaScript, C++, PHP, and Python. I have a pretty good basis of knowledge in HTML and CSS so that can take the backfoot while I learn the other languages necessary to create this website. I don’t think it would be that hard for me to find the skills necessary, I am a quick learner and I reckon it would only take me a year to learn the other languages to a standard where I can develop this website. I would probably use a mix of Codeacademy, Udemy, and DataCamp to learn all the coding languages necessary. It is also necessary for me to learn how website hosting works, as well as look into how I present my website to businesses.</p>

                            <h3>Outcome</h3>

                                <p>If this project is successful, I will be able to start up a website which allows customers to support local businesses while saving money in day to day life. The original issue was that local businesses don’t get the coverage they need, and as soon as they start up, they often die. So, if my idea works, it will boost the local economy while allowing people to save money.</p>
