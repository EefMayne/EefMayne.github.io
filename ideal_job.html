                        <h2>Cyber Security Consultant</h2>
                        
                            <p>The Job that I would love to end up in eventually is as a Cyber Security Consultant. I am interested in this position due to several key reasons. I love people and I believe that im really good at talking to people and doing presentations. Im a motivational speaker, so thats right up my alley. Computers are something that really interests me, and I want to do a job where I work with computers on a daily basis. Hackin is an area that I know a fair bit about, and I would love to use that passion in my work. It is also quite good pay, between $130,000 to $150,000 a year, so thats appealing. So I think that working as a Cyber Security Consultant would be something that I would really enjoy.</p>
                    
                            <p>This position is all about making sure that the company is safe from cyber security breaches, how to cobat these attacks if they do happen, and showing other people how to prevent them in the first place. So it is a massive interpersonal role with a lot of presenting on different Cyber Security topics. You would have to be a quick thinker with the ability to act under pressure. As well as I think that the company would want someone who has had previous experience in a Cyber Security role, as this would ensure that they are getting someone of good caliber. You would have to have a really good idea of how networks function and an ability to understand the workings of your works infrastructure.</p>
                    
                            <p>I am a great team leader, and being in a position where I lead a team of Cyber Security professionals would play to my strengths. Most of my experience in team leading come from leading groups of people at several camps during the year. Presenting to a group of people is a strong point of mine, so I believe that I would excel in a position where it is important to show people how security breaches are made and how the company can do a better job in certain areas. I am great at assessing different situations and then acting based of the results. In regards to experience in this field, I have studied hacking and read several books on the topic and looked at how it works and some ways of how security breaches happen. I hope to eventually do a university degree in Cyber Security to grow my knowledge even more. I am also doing small online courses on the side to learn as much as possible about cyber security and all the different fields. I am teaching myself several different coding languages which will give me the ability to understand how security issues occur, and then I can use that to get a job in Cyber Security.</p>
                    
                            <p>I hope to eventually have the knowledge to be understand how security breaches happen and how they can be stopped. I plan to accomplish this by completing my current Bachlor in Information Technology. And then continuing on to study my Masters in Cyber Security at RMIT. Hopefully after completing my Bachelor in IT, I can find a job doing work in the cyber security field. Then do the Masters degree part time while I work. This will then give me the necessary experience and qualifications to get my ideal job.</p>
