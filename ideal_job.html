                        <h2>Cyber Security Consultant</h2>
                        
                            <p>The Job that I would love to end up in eventually is as a Cyber Security Consultant. I am interested in this position due to several key reasons. I am a great team leader, and being in a position where I lead a team of Cyber Security professionals would play to my strengths. Presenting to a group of people is a strong point of mine, so I believe that I would excel in a position where it is important to show people how security breaches are made and how the company can do a better job in certain areas. I am great at assessing different situations and then acting based of the results. I hope to eventually have the knowledge to be understand how security breaches happen and how they can be stopped. </p>
                    
                            <p>This position is all about making sure that the company is safe from cyber security breaches, how to cobat these attacks if they do happen, and showing other people how to prevent them in the first place. So it is a massive interpersonal role with a lot of presenting on different Cyber Security topics. You would have to be a quick thinker with the ability to act under pressure.
