                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        
                        <p>I was born in Ballarat, Victoria. I lived there for a year and then moved to Nhulunbuy, Northern Territory till I was seven. My family then moved down to Lobethal, South Australia where I live to this very day. I have a younger brother who is 17, and a younger sister who is 12.</p>
                        
                        <p>I speak English mainly, but I can also speak some Aboriginal, French, and Japanese. My main hobby is gaming, but I also make money off it so it's also partly a job.. My fun fact for the day is that I was ranked top five in South Australia for Fortnite and I have won just over $800 in prize money. I also love cars, and everything to do with them.</p>
